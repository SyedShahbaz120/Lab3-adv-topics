# ToDo App

This is a simple ToDo application built using React Native. The app allows users to add tasks, toggle their status between "due" and "done", and delete tasks. The app also ensures that a task cannot be added without a title.

## Features

- **Add a Task**: Users can add a new task with a title. By default, the task status is set to "due".
- **Toggle Task Status**: Users can toggle the status of a task directly from the task list by using a switch. The status can be either "due" or "done".
- **Delete a Task**: Users can delete a task directly from the task list by tapping a delete button.
- **Task Verification**: The "Add Task" button is disabled until the task title input field is not empty to prevent adding tasks without a title.
